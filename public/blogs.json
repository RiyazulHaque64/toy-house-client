    "question": "What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?",
    "answer": "Access Token: An access token is a string representing an authorization issued to the client. Tokens represent specific scopes and duration of access, granted by the resource owner, and enforced by the resource server and authorization server. Refresh Token: A refresh token is issued (along with access token) to the client by the authorization server. And we can store the access token and refresh token in the server-side session."

    "question": "Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?",
    "answer": "An SQL database—also known as a relational database—and named for the programming language it’s written in, Structured Query Language (SQL). It’s the more rigid, structured way of storing data. A relational database management system (RDBMS) executes queries, retrieves data, and edits data by updating, deleting, or creating new records. On the other hand, NoSQL databases--also known as “non SQL” or “not only SQL,” store data in a format other than relational tables."
